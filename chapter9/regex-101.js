/*
  Test
  
  The simplest method of Regular Expression objects
  is test. It receives a string value and returns a
  boolean stating if the pattern matched the text.

/abc/.test('cbabb'); //false

/*
  Character Sets  

  Putting a set of characters between brackets in a
  regular expression makes that part of the expression
  match any characters inside the brackets.

  Within the square brackets, a dash (-) between two
  characters can be used to indicate a range of characters,
  where the ordering is determined by the character's
  unicode number.

  To invert a set of characters, write a caret (^) after
  the first bracket.

/[^abc]/.test('d'); //true;

/*
  Char Group Shortcuts

  In regular expressions, there are a number of character
  groups that have their own built in shortcuts.

  \d - Digit
  \w - Alphanumeric
  \s - Whitespace
  \D - Not digit
  \W - Not alphanumeric
  \S - Not whitespace

/*
  Special Characters

  + - One or more times
  * - Zero or more times
  ? - Optional
  {n} - precise
  {n,n} - range
  {n,} - Open-ended range
  . - Matches all characters except newlines
*/

/\d+/.test('123'); //true
/\d+/.test(''); //false

/\d*/.test('123'); //true
/\d*/.test(''); //true

let neighbor = /neighbou?r/;

let dateTime = /\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}-\d{4} \d{1,2}:\d{2}/;
dateTime.test("30-1-2003 8:45"); //true

/*
  Groups

  A part of a regular expression enclosed by parenthesis is
  called a group, and operators that follow it treat the group
  as a single element.
*/

let crying = /boo+(hoo+)+/;
crying.test('boohooohoo'); //true

/*
  Exec

  Regular Expressions have an exec method that takes
  a string value and, if there is a match, will return
  an array whose first value is a string that represents
  the entire match and whose following values are substrings
  that represent parts of the match that matched groups defined
  within the regular expression. If there is no match, the method
  will return null.

  If the exec is successful, properties of the regular expression
  value will be updated, such as lastIndex and source.

  The returned value stores a .index property that represents
  the index where the match began, and an input property that
  represents the string that the method was called with.
*/

/\d+/.exec('one two 100'); //["100"]
'one two 100'.match(/\d+/); //["100"]
/'([^'])'/.exec("she said 'hello'"); //["'hello'", "hello"]
/bad(ly)?/.exec('bad'); //["bad", undefined]
/(\d)+/.exec('123'); // ["123", "3"]


/*
  Match

  The match method is a property of string values that
  behaves similarly to RegExp.prototype.exec. The difference
  is that, if the g option is enabled, match will return an
  array that contains a list of string values that matched
  the regular expression.

  It's worth emphasizing that the exec method of regex values
  will return information about the *first* match it encounters
  after the *index* defined by *.lastIndex* on the RegExp value, and
  will then update properties on the regex value itself.
*/

function getDate(s) {
  let [_, d, m, y] = s.match(/^(\d{1,2})-(\d{1,2})-(\d{4})$/);
  return new Date(y, m - 1, d);
}

getDate("17-3-1995"); //1995-03-17T07:00:00.000Z

/*
  Boundaries

  ^ - Matches the start of the string
  $ - Matches the end of the string
  \b - Matches \w bordered by \W or ^$. Does not match an actual character.
*/

let words = 'Merry dol, derry dol';
/(\b\w+\b)+/g.exec(words); //[ 'Merry', 'dol', 'derry', 'dol' ]

/*
  Choice patterns

  The pipe character (|) denotes a choice between 
  the pattern to its left and the pattern to its right.
*/

let animalCount = /\b\d+ (pig|cow|duck)s?\b/;

/*
  The replace method

  The replace method is part of the String class.

  The first argument can either be a string or a regex value,
  and is used to match parts of the string. (To match multiple
  parts of the string, the g option must be added to the regex).
  When a match occurs, the second argument determines what should
  replace that part of the string. The second argument can either
  be a string or a function.
  
  A string as the second argument: if the matching expression uses
  groups, the groups can be referred to by using $n notation, where n
  is a number that denotes the place of the group in the order of groups 
  in the regular expression, starting at 1.
  
  It is possible to refer to the whole match using $&.

  A function as the second argument: if the matching expression uses
  groups, the substrings matching the groups are passed as arguments
  starting at the second argument. The first argument is the whole
  match itself. The return value from the function determines the
  replacement.

/*
  Regex properties (source, lastIndex)

  The source property contained in a formed
  regular expression is binded to the string
  expression that it was created from.

  The lastIndex property will, in some
  circumstances, control where the next
  match will start. Those circumstances
  are that either the global (g) or sticky
  (y) flags are enabled and the match should
  happen through the exec method.

  The difference between global and sticky
  is that, when sticky is enabled, the match
  must begin at the start of the last index,
  whereas with global it will search ahead.

  The unicode option

  By default, JavaScript regular expressions match
  based on code units, and as stated in chapter 5,
  some characters are represented by two code units.
  
  If you're testing for three apple emojis and use the
  precise operator ({3}), by default, it will apply to only 
  to the last code unit, and that is not what we want.

  To solve for this, add the u option to the regular expression.
  This stands for unicode, and will adjust the behavior of the
  regular expression to work correctly.
