A canvas is an HTML node that that provides a programming interface for drawing pictures on a space defined by the dimensions of the canvas node.

## SVGs

Think of SVG as a document-markup dialect that focuses on shapes rather than text. You can embed an SVG document directly in an HTML document or include it with an <img> tag.
