# Introduction

## Programming Language

A programming language is a syntax used to instruct computers, and differs from that of a graphical interface, which is also used to instruct computers but is much more limited.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that can be used in the web browser as well as in environments such as Node.js. It was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to the Netscape Navigator browser.

## ECMAScript Standard

A standard that states how JavaScript should work.

## Programs

Put simply, a program is a sequence of instructions for a computer.

Computers can only do very straightforward things. The advantage that they bring is that they can do these straightforward things at very high speeds, and that these straighforward things can be combined together to do very complex things.

Programs are buildings of thought. They are weightless, costless, and grow ever increasingly.

### The Problem of Programs

Programs can become very large and complex. The art of programming is subduing this complexity.

## Code

Code is the text that makes up programs.
