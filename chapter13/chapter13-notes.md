## Network Protocol

A network protocol describes a style of communication over a network. There are protocols for a variety of activities: sending email, fetching email, or sharing files, to name a few.

## HTTP Protocol

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a style of communication for retrieving named resources.

## Transmission Control Protocol

A TCP connection is where one computer must be waiting, or listening, for other computers to start talking to it. The listening computer is composed of ports, each of which designated for a certain style of communication. Another computer can establish a connection with the listening computer by using the correct port number. The listening computer is called the _server_, and the connecting computer is called the _client_.

## Uniform Resource Locator

Each document on the web is named by a URL, which takes the following form: http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_browser.html. (protocol|server|path).

## IP Address

Machines connected to the internet get an IP address, which is an address used to send messages to that machine. IP addresses are hard to read, so we registed domain names to point to an IP address.

## HTML

HTML is the document format used for web pages. They contain a head and a body; the head contains information about the document and the body contains the document itself.

(UTF-8 is a way to encode unicode text as binary data. UTF-8 = Unicode).

HTML uses what are called tags. Tags are used to structure the document and can contain what are called attributes. Attributes are key value pairs used to pass extra information to a tag.

In HTML, an ampersand followed by a name or a character code then a semicolon is called an entity and will be replaced by the encoded character when the document renders.
