# Data Structures

Data structures are the particular ways that a collection of values are stored. Good data structures are defined in such a way as to allow a programmer to retrieve a modify data efficiently.

## Arrays

An array is value for stories sequences of other values.

### Indexes

Every value in an array has an index, which starts at 0 for the first value, and increments by one for every preceding value. A values index can be thought of as the amount of values to skip in an array to reach that value.

## Properties

Every value in JavaScript, except null & undefined, have properties. Properties store useful information about a value, and can also store functions that have useful functionality related to the value.
